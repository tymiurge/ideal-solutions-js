test double:
  - dummy object
  - test stub
  - test spy
  - mock object
  - fake object

dummy object:
  - is really an alternative to the value patterns

test stub:
  - 1: .. so that the test has a control point
       for the indirect inputs of the SUT (system under testing)
  - variations:
    - responder injects valid values
    - saboteur injects errors or exceptions
test spy: 
  - 1: Test Spy (page 538), as
       an observation point for the indirect outputs of the SUT. Like a Test Stub, a
       Test Spy may need to provide values to the SUT in response to method calls.
       The Test Spy, however, also captures the indirect outputs of the SUT as it is
       exercised and saves them for later verifi cation by the test.
test mock: 
  - 1: We can use a Mock Object as an observation point to verify the indirect outputs
       of the SUT as it is exercised. Typically, the Mock Object also includes the func-
       tionality of a Test Stub in that it must return values to the SUT if it hasnâ€™t already
       failed the tests but the emphasis1 is on the verifi cation of the indirect outputs.
fake object:
  - 1: We use a Fake Object (page 551) to replace the functionality of a real DOC
       in a test for reasons other than verifi cation of indirect inputs and outputs of
       the SUT. Typically, a Fake Object implements the same functionality as the
       real DOC but in a much simpler way.
