a single data
source for all the tests, which speeds up feedback slightly, but requires teams to
sacrifice isolation. One test can mess things up easily for other tests, and
generally any idea of parallel test execution goes out of the window.

A common alternative is for tests to execute using a simplified, minimised data
set, (?? PER EACH OF TESTS??) which is faster to set up. This speeds up feedback but sacrifices reliability.

THIS ALTERNATIVE ONLY FOR DESIGNED PROPERLY SOFTWARE
MEANING SOFTWARE THAT IS ABLE TO CHANGE DB AT THE FLY
The third solution, common with teams that develop most of their software using
object-oriented platforms, is to run tests against a specialised testing database.
Ideally, object-oriented data access libraries should take care of database access,
so the same test can in theory be executed against any type of data source. This
leads to tests with in-memory databases which require no disk access and can be
started inside the test runner process.
