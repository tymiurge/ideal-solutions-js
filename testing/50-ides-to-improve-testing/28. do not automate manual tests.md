A manual test, even when it’s a detailed script, gives testers the opportunity to
spot tangential information, such as unexpected events and layout problems.

Manual tests provide 
MOST VALUE WHEN THEY ARE NOT EXECUTED BY BLINDLY FOLLOWING
just what’s written on a piece of paper, 
BUT BY USING THE TEST MORE AS A GUIDLINE FOR INVESTIGATION
With automated tests, this is not possible, so all that
extra value is lost.

Manual tests work well when they provide the context, even if they leave out
specifics.
On the other hand, automated tests work well only when they are very specific.
