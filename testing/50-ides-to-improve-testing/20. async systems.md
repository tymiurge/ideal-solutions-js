Waiting for an event instead of waiting for a period of time is the preferred way
of testing asynchronous systems, but when you need to check that something
does not happen, there is no event to wait for. The only option is to wait for
some arbitrary period of time.

A good solution for such situations is to ask ‘what happens instead?’ and validate
the resulting condition. For example, instead of checking that a transaction does
not exist after a period of time, check that a failed transaction was logged in an
audit trail.
