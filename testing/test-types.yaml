smoke:
  defs: 
    def1: | Smoke testing is an approach where all areas of the software application are tested
          | without getting into too deep
    def2: | Minimal attempts to operate the software, designed to determine whether there are any 
          | basic problems that will prevent it from working at all
sanity:
  defs: 
    def1: | it is a narrow regression testing with a focus on one or a small set of areas of functionality 
          | of the software application
    def2: | determines whether it is reasonable to proceed with further testing

acceptance:
  def:    | Acceptance Testing is a level of the software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. 
          | The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and 
          | assess whether it is acceptable for delivery. Definition by ISTQB.
  types: [
    - Alpha & Beta Testing,
    - Contract Acceptance Testing,
    - Regulation Acceptance Testing,
    - Operational Acceptance Testing:
          | Operational Readiness Testing or Production Acceptance Testing, these test cases ensure there are 
          | workflows in place to allow the software or system to be used.
          | This should include workflows for backup plans, user training, and various maintenance processes and security checks.

alpha:
  def:    | Normally takes place in the development environment and is usually done by internal staff 
          | – long before the product is even released to external testers or customers. Alpha Testing can also 
          | be done by potential user groups, but the important thing here is that it takes place in 
          | the development environment.
beta:
  def:    | Also known as “field testing”, takes place in the customer’s environment and involves some extensive testing 
          | by a group of customers who use the system in their environment.
