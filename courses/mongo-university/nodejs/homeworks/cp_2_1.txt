Suppose our movie details documents are structured so that rather than contain an awards field that looks like this:

"awards" : {
    "wins" : 56,
    "nominations" : 86,
    "text" : "Won 2 Oscars. Another 56 wins and 86 nominations."
}

they are structured with an awards field as follows:

"awards" : {
    "oscars" : [
        {"award": "bestAnimatedFeature", "result": "won"},
        {"award": "bestMusic", "result": "won"},
        {"award": "bestPicture", "result": "nominated"},
        {"award": "bestSoundEditing", "result": "nominated"},
        {"award": "bestScreenplay", "result": "nominated"}
    ],
    "wins" : 56,
    "nominations" : 86,
    "text" : "Won 2 Oscars. Another 56 wins and 86 nominations."
}

What query would we use in the Mongo shell to return all movies in the video.movieDetails collection that either won or were nominated for a best picture Oscar? You may assume that an award will appear in the oscars array only if the movie won or was nominated. You will probably want to create a little sample data for yourself in order to work this problem.

answer: 
db.movieDetails.find({"awards.oscars.award": "bestPicture"})
