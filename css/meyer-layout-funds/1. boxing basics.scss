/*   ================================ boxes  ================================*/

/* Each element box has a content area at its center */
/**
    the content area is surrounded by optional amounts of
    - padding (can't be negative)
    - borders (can't be negative)
    - margins (can be negative, always transperent!!!)

 /**
    Kinds of boxes and some important terms
    - normal flow
    - nonreplaced element (elmnt whose content is contained within
      the document)
    - replaced element (elemnt that serves as a placeholder
      for something else - i.e. img)
    - root element (html in html)
    - block box - element that generate "new lines" both
      before and after their boxes when in the normal flow
      Any element can be made to generate a block box by declaring
      display: block
    - inline box - i.e. default span or strong - they done't
      generate linebreaks
      any element can be made "inline" by declaring
      display: inline
    - inline-block box: This is a box that is like a block box
      internally, but acts like an inline box externally.
      It acts similar to, but not quite the same as,
      a replaced element. Imagine picking up a div and sticking
      it into a line of text as if it were an inline image
    - containing block: the containing block is the
      “layout context” for a box.
