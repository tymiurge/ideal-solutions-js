/*
vertical formatting also has seven related properties: 
margin-top,         border-top,     padding-top, 
                      height, 
padding-bottom,     border-bottom,  margin-bottom.

!!!!!!!!
The values of these seven properties must equal the height 
of the block box’s contain‐ ing block.
!!!!!!!!
Only three of these seven properties may be set to auto: 
the height of the element, and the top and bottom margins.
!!!!!!!!
If either margin-top or margin-bottom is set to auto for a block box 
in the normal flow, they both automatically evaluate to 0. 
A value of 0 unfortunately prevents easy vertical centering of 
normal-flow boxes in their containing blocks. 
It also means that if you set the top and bottom margins of 
an element to auto, they are effectively reset to 0 
and removed from the element box.
