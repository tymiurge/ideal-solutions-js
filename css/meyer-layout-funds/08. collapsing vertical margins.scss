/*
given: 
li {margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px;}

Each list item has a 10-pixel top margin and a 15-pixel bottom margin. 
When the list is rendered, however, the distance between adjacent list 
items is 
    !!!!   15 pixels !!!!!, 
    !!!!   not 25    !!!!!

This happens because, along the vertical axis, adjacent margins 
are collapsed. 
In other words, the smaller of the two margins is eliminated 
in favor of the larger.
