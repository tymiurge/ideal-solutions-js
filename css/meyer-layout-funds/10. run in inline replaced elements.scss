<h3 style="display: run-in; border: 1px dotted; font-size: 125%;

    <p style="border-top: 1px solid black; padding-top: 0.5em;">
    Another interesting block/inline hybrid is the value <code>run-in</code>,
    introduced in CSS2, which has the ability to take block-level elements and make
    them an inline part of a following element. This is useful for certain heading
    effects that are quite common in print typography, where a heading will appear
    as part of a paragraph of text.
