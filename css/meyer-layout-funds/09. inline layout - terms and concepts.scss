Anonymous text
    This is any string of characters that is not contained within an inline element. 
    Thus, in the markup <p> I'm <em>so</em> happy!</p>, the sequences “ I’m ” and “ happy!” are anonymous text. 
    Note that the spaces are part of the text since a space is a character like any other.
Em box
    This is defined in the given font, otherwise known as the character box. 
    Actual glyphs can be taller or shorter than their em boxes. In CSS, the value of font-size 
    determines the height of each em box.
Content area
    In nonreplaced elements, the content area can be one of two things, 
    and the CSS specification allows user agents to choose which one. 
    The content area can be the box described by the em boxes of every character in the element, 
    strung together; or it can be the box described by the character glyphs in the element. 
    In this book, I use the em box definition for simplicity’s sake. 
    In replaced elements, the content area is the intrinsic height of the element plus any margins, 
    borders, or padding.
Leading
    Leading is the difference between the values of font-size and line-height. 
    This difference is actually divided in half and is applied equally to the top and bottom of the content area. 
    These additions to the content area are called, not surprisingly, half-leading. 
    Leading is applied only to nonreplaced elements.
Inline box
    This is the box described by the addition of the leading to the content area. 
    For nonreplaced elements, the height of the inline box of an element will be exactly equal 
    to the value for line-height. For replaced elements, the height of the inline box of an element 
    will be exactly equal to the content area, since leading is not applied to replaced elements.
Line box
    This is the shortest box that bounds the highest and lowest points of the inline boxes that are found 
    in the line. In other words, the top edge of the line box is placed along the top of the highest 
    inline box top, and the bottom of the line box is placed along the bottom of the lowest inline box bottom.
