## Overview 
The project was bootstraped with react-create-app. It doesn't use any css frameworks (like Twitter Bootstrap) and all the representation was created from scratch (however it still leaves much to be desired) with means of scss. 

The used stack is react + redux + react-redux + react-router-dom + react-thunk 

All the actions are logged to console with react-logger. 

## Prerequisites
- node 
- npm 

I used v8.9.1 and 5.5.1 respectively 

## To run 
clone the project and run the following commands from it's directory:
```
npm install
npm start
```
The application will be available at localhost:3000.

## Changing scss
From the project directory (**and in different from the "npm run" terminal!**) run 
```
npm run sass
```
